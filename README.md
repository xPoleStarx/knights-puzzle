# Logic Puzzle Solver

This is a logic puzzle solver implemented in Python. It uses a logical sentence representation and provides a method to check if a knowledge base entails a query.

## Puzzle Description

There are four puzzles included in this solver:

1. **Puzzle 0**: A says "I am both a knight and a knave."
2. **Puzzle 1**: A says "We are both knaves."
3. **Puzzle 2**: A says "We are the same kind." B says "We are of different kinds."
4. **Puzzle 3**: A says either "I am a knight." or "I am a knave.", but you don't know which. B says "A said 'I am a knave'." B says "C is a knave." C says "A is a knight."

## Usage

To solve the puzzles, run the `puzzle.py` script:

```
python puzzle.py
```

The script will print the solutions for each puzzle, indicating the identities of the knights and knaves based on the given information.

## Requirements
